### providers.md (v5.0.0)
**When:** Using non-Claude providers (Codex, Gemini), understanding degraded mode
- Provider comparison matrix
- Claude (full features) vs Codex/Gemini (degraded mode)

## How to Load

```python
# Example: Before implementing a feature with tests
# 1. Read this index
# 2. Decide: need model-selection.md + testing.md
# 3. Read those files
# 4. Execute with loaded context
```

**Remember:** Loading fewer modules = more context for actual work.
