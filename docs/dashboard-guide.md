# Loki Mode Dashboard v5.38.0

A production-ready realtime dashboard for monitoring and managing Loki Mode autonomous operations. Features a dark Vercel/Linear-inspired theme with purple accents, sidebar navigation, and overview cards.

## Overview

The Loki Mode Dashboard provides a visual interface to:
- Monitor task progress across Kanban columns
- Track active agents and their status
- View system health (RARV cycle, memory, quality gates)
- View Completion Council verdicts and convergence status
- Manage human intervention (pause/stop)
- Add and organize local tasks

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the dashboard (default port: 57374)
loki dashboard start

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:57374
```

The dashboard automatically syncs with Loki Mode when it's running, polling `dashboard-state.json` every 2 seconds.

**Ports:** The dashboard and API run on unified port **57374** (FastAPI serves both). See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md#ports) for details.

## Design System

### Dark Vercel/Linear Design Language

The dashboard follows a dark Vercel/Linear-inspired design with purple accents:

**Dark Mode (Default)**:
```css
--bg-primary: #0a0a0b;    /* Deep dark background */
--bg-secondary: #141416;  /* Card surfaces */
--bg-card: #1a1a1d;       /* Elevated surfaces */
--accent: #8b5cf6;        /* Purple accent */
--text-primary: #f5f5f5;  /* Near white text */
```

**Light Mode**:
```css
--bg-primary: #faf9f0;    /* Cream background */
--bg-secondary: #f5f4eb;  /* Sidebar/cards */
--bg-card: #ffffff;       /* Card background */
--accent: #7c3aed;        /* Purple accent */
--text-primary: #1a1a1a;  /* Near black text */
```

### Typography
- **Primary font**: Inter (system font fallback)
- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono (for IDs, code, numbers)

### Status Colors
| Status | Light Mode | Dark Mode |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Success | #16a34a | #22c55e |
| Warning | #ca8a04 | #eab308 |

### 6. Completion Council (v5.25.0)

The Completion Council panel provides visibility into the multi-agent definition-of-done system:

#### Overview Tab
- Current council state (active, idle, reviewing)
- Latest verdict (CONTINUE, COMPLETE, FORCE_STOP)
- Vote tally from 3 council members (2/3 majority required)

#### Decision Log Tab
- Chronological history of all council verdicts
- Per-member vote breakdown
- Anti-sycophancy devil's advocate triggers (shown when unanimous approval occurs)

#### Convergence Tab
- Git diff hash tracking between iterations
- Convergence detection (repeated identical diffs = no progress)
- Circuit breaker status (triggers after 5 consecutive no-progress iterations)

#### Agents Tab
- Council member status and assignment
- Current review focus areas

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/council/state` - Current council state
- `GET /api/council/verdicts` - Decision history
- `GET /api/council/convergence` - Convergence metrics
- `POST /api/council/force-review` - Trigger manual review

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
loki council status         # Current state
loki council verdicts       # Decision history
loki council convergence    # Convergence data
loki council force-review   # Trigger review
loki council report         # Generate report
```

## Security Hardening (v5.25.0)

The dashboard includes several security measures:

| Fix | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Path traversal prevention** | `storage.py` validates all file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks |
| **XSS protection** | Log stream output is sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting |
| **Memory leak fix** | Session control properly cleans up resources on disconnect |
| **Python injection fix** | `completion-council.sh` sanitizes inputs to prevent code injection |
| **CORS configuration** | Configurable via `LOKI_DASHBOARD_CORS` environment variable (default: localhost only) |

---

## Technical Architecture

### File-Based Sync

The dashboard uses a polling-based sync mechanism:

```
run.sh                     Dashboard
   |                           |
   |-- writes every 2s -->     |
   |                           |
   v                           v
dashboard-state.json       fetch() + render
```

**State File Structure** (`dashboard-state.json`):
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-21T10:30:00Z",
  "version": "5.25.0",
  "mode": "autonomous",
  "phase": "DEVELOPMENT",
  "complexity": "standard",
  "iteration": 5,
  "tasks": {
    "pending": [...],
    "inProgress": [...],
    "review": [...],
    "completed": [...],
    "failed": [...]
  },
  "agents": [...],
  "metrics": {
    "tasksCompleted": 12,
    "tasksFailed": 0,
    "cpuUsage": 45,
    "memoryUsage": 62
  },
  "rarv": {
    "currentStep": 1,
    "stages": ["reason", "act", "reflect", "verify"]
  },
  "memory": {
    "episodic": 12,
    "semantic": 8,
    "procedural": 5
  },
  "qualityGates": {
    "staticAnalysis": "passed",
    "codeReview": "in_progress",
    "antiSycophancy": "pending",
    "testCoverage": "passed",
    "securityScan": "passed",
    "performance": "pending"
  }
}
```

### Local Storage

Local tasks persist in browser localStorage:
- Key: `loki-dashboard-local`
- Survives browser refresh
- Independent of server state

Theme preference:
- Key: `loki-theme`
- Values: `light` or `dark`

---

## Responsive Design

The dashboard adapts to different screen sizes:

| Breakpoint | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| > 1400px | Full layout, 5 stat cards |
| 1200-1400px | 3 stat cards, 2 system cards |
| 1024-1200px | Sidebar hidden, mobile header visible |
| < 768px | Single column layout |

### Mobile Header
On small screens, a mobile header appears with:
- Loki Mode logo
- Connection status
- Theme toggle

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Cmd/Ctrl + N | Open Add Task modal |
| Escape | Close modal |

---

## Export

Click "Export" button to download JSON containing:
- Current server state snapshot
- All local tasks
- Export timestamp

Useful for:
- Debugging
- Sharing session state
- Backup before making changes

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Shows "Offline"
1. Ensure Loki Mode is running: `./autonomy/run.sh`
2. Check that `dashboard-state.json` exists in `.loki/`
3. Verify HTTP server is running on correct port

### Tasks Not Updating
1. Check polling interval (default: 2 seconds)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for fetch errors

### Theme Not Saving
1. Check localStorage is enabled
2. Clear `loki-theme` key and refresh

### Local Tasks Disappeared
1. Check localStorage is enabled
2. Different browser/profile will have separate local storage
3. Export tasks before clearing browser data
