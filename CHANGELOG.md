## [2.20.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added - Benchmark Execution Mode

#### `--execute` Flag for Benchmarks
Full implementation of benchmark execution that runs problems through Claude:

**HumanEval Execution** (`benchmarks/run-benchmarks.sh humaneval --execute`):
- Sends each of 164 Python problems to Claude
- Receives solution code from Claude
- Executes solution against HumanEval test cases
- Tracks pass/fail results with real-time progress
- Saves solutions to `humaneval-solutions/` directory
- Compares results to MetaGPT baseline (85.9-87.7%)

**SWE-bench Execution** (`benchmarks/run-benchmarks.sh swebench --execute`):
- Loads SWE-bench Lite dataset (300 real GitHub issues)
- Generates git patches for each issue using Claude
- Saves patches for SWE-bench evaluator
- Outputs predictions file compatible with official harness

**New Options**:
- `--execute` - Actually run problems through Claude (vs setup only)
- `--limit N` - Only run first N problems (useful for testing)
- `--model MODEL` - Claude model to use (default: sonnet)
- `--timeout N` - Timeout per problem in seconds (default: 120)
- `--parallel N` - Run N problems in parallel (default: 1)

**Example Usage**:
```bash
# Run first 10 HumanEval problems
./benchmarks/run-benchmarks.sh humaneval --execute --limit 10

# Run all 164 problems with Opus
./benchmarks/run-benchmarks.sh humaneval --execute --model opus

# Run 5 SWE-bench problems
./benchmarks/run-benchmarks.sh swebench --execute --limit 5
```

### Changed
- Benchmark runner now has two modes: SETUP (default) and EXECUTE
- Results include pass rates, timing, and competitor comparison
- Summary generation includes actual benchmark results when available

## [2.18.5] - 2026-01-04

### Added
- **System Resource Monitoring** - Prevents computer overload from too many parallel agents (run.sh:786-899):
  - **Background Resource Monitor** checks CPU and memory usage every 5 minutes (configurable)
  - **Automatic Warnings** logged when CPU or memory exceeds thresholds (default: 80%)
  - **Resources JSON File** (`.loki/state/resources.json`) contains real-time resource status
  - **RARV Integration** - Claude checks resources.json during REASON step and throttles agents if needed
  - **macOS & Linux Support** - Platform-specific CPU/memory detection using `top`, `vm_stat`, `free`
  - **Configurable Thresholds** via environment variables:
    - `LOKI_RESOURCE_CHECK_INTERVAL` (default: 300 seconds = 5 minutes)
    - `LOKI_RESOURCE_CPU_THRESHOLD` (default: 80%)
    - `LOKI_RESOURCE_MEM_THRESHOLD` (default: 80%)

### Changed
- **RARV Cycle** - Updated REASON step to check `.loki/state/resources.json` for warnings (run.sh:1194)
  - If CPU or memory is high, Claude will reduce parallel agent spawning or pause non-critical tasks
  - Prevents system from becoming unusable due to too many agents
- **Cleanup Handlers** - `stop_status_monitor()` now also stops resource monitor (run.sh:335)

### Why This Matters
**User Problem:** "Loki Mode spinning agents made my computer unusable and I had to hard restart"
**Solution:** Resource monitoring prevents this by:
1. Continuously tracking CPU and memory usage every 5 minutes
2. Warning when thresholds are exceeded
3. Allowing Claude to self-throttle by reducing agent count
4. User can configure thresholds based on their hardware

### Impact
- **Prevents System Overload:** No more hard restarts due to too many parallel agents
- **Self-Regulating:** Claude automatically reduces agent spawning when resources are constrained
- **Transparent:** Resource status visible in `.loki/state/resources.json`
- **Configurable:** Users can set custom thresholds for their hardware
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on macOS and Linux
- **User Request:** Directly addresses "add capability to check cpu and memory every few mins and let claude take decision on it"

## [2.18.4] - 2026-01-04

### Changed
- **README.md Complete Restructure** - Transformed README to focus on value proposition and user experience:
  - **New Hero Section:** Clear tagline "The First Truly Autonomous Multi-Agent Startup System" with compelling value prop
  - **"Why Loki Mode?" Section:** Direct comparison table showing what others do vs. what Loki Mode does
  - **Core Advantages List:** 5 key differentiators (truly autonomous, massively parallel, production-ready, self-improving, zero babysitting)
  - **Dashboard & Real-Time Monitoring Section:** Dedicated section showcasing agent monitoring and task queue visualization with screenshot placeholders
  - **Autonomous Capabilities Section:** Prominent explanation of RARV cycle, perpetual improvement mode, and auto-resume/self-healing
  - **Simplified Quick Start:** 5-step getting started guide with clear "walk away" messaging
  - **Cleaner Installation:** Moved detailed installation steps to separate INSTALLATION.md
  - **Better Structure:** Logical flow from "what it is" → "why it's better" → "how to use it" → "how it works"

### Added
- **INSTALLATION.md** - Comprehensive installation guide with all platforms:
  - Table of contents for easy navigation
  - Quick install section (recommended approach)
  - Three installation options for Claude Code (git clone, releases, minimal curl)
  - Claude.ai web installation instructions
  - Anthropic API Console installation instructions
  - Verify installation section for all platforms
  - Troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
  - Updating and uninstalling instructions

- **docs/screenshots/** - Screenshot directory with detailed instructions:
  - README.md explaining what screenshots to capture
  - Specifications for dashboard-agents.png and dashboard-tasks.png
  - Step-by-step instructions for creating screenshots
  - Alternative methods using test fixtures
  - Guidelines for professional, clean screenshots

### Impact
- **User Experience:** README now immediately conveys value and differentiators
- **Clarity:** Installation details no longer clutter the main README
- **Visual Appeal:** Dashboard screenshots section makes capabilities tangible
- **Competitive Positioning:** Clear comparison shows why Loki Mode is better than alternatives
- **Autonomous Focus:** RARV cycle and perpetual improvement are now prominent features
- **Ease of Use:** Quick Start shows users can literally "walk away" after starting Loki Mode
- **Professional Documentation:** Meets industry standards with proper structure, badges, and navigation
- **User Request:** Directly addresses "focus on what it is, how it's better than anything out there, autonomous capabilities, usage for the user, dashboard screenshots and standard things"

## [2.18.3] - 2026-01-04

### Changed
- **Clarified Agent Scaling Model** - Fixed misleading "37 agents" references across all documentation:
  - **README.md:** Badge changed to "Agent Types: 37", description now emphasizes dynamic scaling (few agents for simple projects, 100+ for complex startups)
  - **README.md:** Features table updated to "37 agent types across 6 swarms - dynamically spawned based on workload"
  - **README.md:** Comparison table changed "Agents: 37" → "Agent Types: 37 (dynamically spawned)" and added "Parallel Scaling" row
  - **README.md:** Vibe Kanban benefits changed from "all 37 agents" → "all active agents"
  - **SKILL.md:** Section header changed to "Agent Types (37 Specialized Types)" with clarification about dynamic spawning
  - **SKILL.md:** All swarm headers changed from "(X agents)" → "(X types)"
  - **SKILL.md:** Example updated from "37 parallel agents" → "100+ parallel agents"
  - **CONTEXT-EXPORT.md:** Updated to emphasize "37 specialized agent types" and dynamic scaling
  - **agents.md:** Header changed to "Agent Type Definitions" with note about dynamic spawning based on project needs
  - **integrations/vibe-kanban.md:** Changed "all 37 Loki agents" → "all active Loki agents"

### Why This Matters
The previous "37 agents" messaging was misleading because:
- **37 is the number of agent TYPES**, not the number of agents that spawn
- Loki Mode **dynamically spawns** only the agents needed for your specific project
- A simple todo app might use 5-10 agents total
- A complex startup could spawn 100+ agents working in parallel (multiple instances of the same type)
- The system is designed for **functionality-based scaling**, not fixed counts

### Impact
- **Clarity:** Eliminates confusion about how many agents will actually run
- **Realistic Expectations:** Users understand the system scales to their needs
- **Accuracy:** Documentation now reflects the actual dynamic agent spawning behavior
- **User Feedback:** Directly addresses user question about why docs mention "37 agents"

## [2.18.2] - 2026-01-04

### Added
- **Agent Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time visibility into active agents (run.sh:330-735):
  - **Active Agents Section** with grid layout displaying all spawned agents
  - **Agent Cards** showing:
    - Agent ID and type (general-purpose, QA, DevOps, etc.)
    - Model badge with color coding (Sonnet = blue, Haiku = orange, Opus = purple)
    - Current status (active/completed)
    - Current work being performed
    - Runtime duration (e.g., "2h 15m")
    - Tasks completed count
  - **Active Agents Stat** in top stats bar
  - Auto-refreshes every 3 seconds alongside task queue
  - Responsive grid layout (adapts to screen size)

- **Agent State Aggregator** - Collects agent data for dashboard (run.sh:737-773):
  - `update_agents_state()` function aggregates `.agent/sub-agents/*.json` files
  - Writes to `.loki/state/agents.json` for dashboard consumption
  - Runs every 5 seconds via status monitor (run.sh:305, 311)
  - Handles missing directories gracefully (returns empty array)
  - Supports agent lineage schema from CONSTITUTION.md

### Changed
- **Dashboard Layout** - Reorganized for agent monitoring (run.sh:622-630):
  - Added "Active Agents" section header above agent grid
  - Added "Task Queue" section header above task columns
  - Reordered stats to show "Active Agents" first
  - Enhanced visual hierarchy with section separators

- **Status Monitor** - Now updates agent state alongside tasks (run.sh:300-319):
  - Calls `update_agents_state()` on startup
  - Updates agents.json every 5 seconds in background loop
  - Provides real-time agent tracking data for dashboard

### Impact
- **Visibility:** Real-time monitoring of all active agents, their models, and work
- **Performance Tracking:** See which agents are using which models (Haiku vs Sonnet vs Opus)
- **Debugging:** Quickly identify stuck agents or unbalanced workloads
- **Cost Awareness:** Visual indication of model usage (expensive Opus vs cheap Haiku)
- **User Request:** Directly addresses user's question "can you also have ability to see how many agents and their roles and work being done and their model?"

## [2.18.1] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **Model Selection Hierarchy** - Corrected default model documentation (SKILL.md:83-91):
  - **Sonnet 4.5** is now clearly marked as **DEFAULT** for all standard implementation work
  - **Haiku 4.5** changed to **OPTIMIZATION ONLY** for simple/parallelizable tasks
  - **Opus 4.5** changed to **COMPLEX ONLY** for architecture & security
  - Previous documentation incorrectly suggested Haiku as default for most subagents
  - Aligns with best practices: Sonnet for quality, Haiku for speed optimization only

- **run.sh Implementation Gap** - RARV cycle now implemented in runner script (run.sh:870-871, 908-916):
  - Updated `rar_instruction` to `rarv_instruction` with full VERIFY step
  - Added "Mistakes & Learnings" reading in REASON step
  - Added self-verification loop: test → fail → capture error → update CONTINUITY.md → retry
  - Added git checkpoint rollback on verification failure
  - Mentions 2-3x quality improvement from self-verification
  - **CRITICAL FIX:** v2.18.0 documented RARV but run.sh still used old RAR cycle
  - run.sh now aligns with SKILL.md patterns

### Impact
- **Clarity:** Eliminates confusion about which model to use by default
- **Consistency:** run.sh now implements what SKILL.md documents
- **Quality:** Self-verification loop now active in production runs (not just documentation)
- **Real-World Testing:** Fixes gap identified during actual project usage

## [2.18.0] - 2026-01-04

### Added
- **Self-Updating Learning System** - Agents learn from mistakes automatically (SKILL.md:253-278):
  - "Mistakes & Learnings" section in CONTINUITY.md template
  - Error → Learning → Prevention pattern
  - Self-update protocol: capture error, analyze root cause, write learning, retry
  - Example format with timestamp, agent ID, what failed, why, how to prevent
  - Prevents repeating same errors across agent spawns

- **Automatic Self-Verification Loop (RARV Cycle)** - 2-3x quality improvement (SKILL.md:178-229):
  - Enhanced RAR to RARV: Reason → Act → Reflect → **Verify**
  - VERIFY step runs automated tests after every change
  - Feedback loop: Test → Fail → Learn → Update CONTINUITY.md → Retry
  - Rollback to last good git checkpoint on verification failure
  - Achieves 2-3x quality improvement (Boris Cherny's observed result)
  - AI tests its own work automatically

- **Extended Thinking Mode Guidance** - For complex problems (SKILL.md:89-107):
  - Added "Thinking Mode" column to model selection table
  - Sonnet 4.5 with thinking for complex debugging, architecture
  - Opus 4.5 with thinking for system design, security reviews
  - When to use: architecture decisions, complex debugging, security analysis
  - When NOT to use: simple tasks (wastes time and tokens)
  - How it works: Model shows reasoning in `<thinking>` tags

### Changed
- **RARV Cycle** - Enhanced from RAR to include VERIFY step (SKILL.md:178):
  - Added "READ Mistakes & Learnings" to REASON step
  - Added "git checkpoint" note to ACT step
  - Added complete VERIFY step with failure handling protocol
  - Loop back to REASON on verification failure with learned context

- **Quick Reference** - Updated with new patterns (SKILL.md:14-20):

  - Step 4: RARV cycle (added VERIFY)
  - Step 6: NEW - Learn from errors pattern
  - Essential Patterns: Added "Self-Verification Loop (Boris Cherny)"
  - Memory Hierarchy: Added CONSTITUTION.md, noted "Mistakes & Learnings"

- **Model Selection Table** - Added Thinking Mode column (SKILL.md:83-87):
  - Haiku: Not available
  - Sonnet: "Use for complex problems"
  - Opus: "Use for architecture"

### Inspired By
**Boris Cherny (Creator of Claude Code) - "Max Setup" Pattern:**
- Self-updating CLAUDE.md based on mistakes (we adapted to CONTINUITY.md)
- Let AI test its own work (2-3x quality improvement observed)
- Extended thinking mode for complex problems
- "Less prompting, more systems. Parallelize + standardize + verify."

### Impact
- **Quality Improvement:** 2-3x (from automatic self-verification loop)
- **Error Reduction:** Mistakes logged and prevented from repeating
- **Learning System:** Agents build institutional knowledge over time
- **Debugging Speed:** Extended thinking improves complex problem-solving

### Migration Notes

  - Decision Tree flowchart for "What To Do Next?"
  - SDLC Phase Flow diagram (high-level overview)
  - Essential Patterns (one-line quick reference)
  - Common Issues & Solutions troubleshooting table

### Changed
- **Consolidated Redundant Templates** - Improved maintainability:
  - CONTINUITY.md template: Single canonical version (lines 152-190), referenced in bootstrap
  - Task Completion Report: Single canonical template (lines 298-341), all duplicates now reference it
  - Severity-Based Blocking: Detailed table (lines 2639-2647), simplified version references it
- **Improved Navigation** - Better file organization:
  - Added comprehensive Table of Contents with categorized sections
  - Cross-references between related sections
  - Line number references for quick jumps

### Fixed
- Removed duplicate CONTINUITY.md template from bootstrap script (was lines 2436-2470)
- Removed duplicate Task Completion Report from subagent dispatch section (was lines 1731-1764)
- Consolidated severity matrices (removed duplicates, kept one authoritative version)

## [2.14.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Claude Code Best Practices** - Integrated patterns from "Claude Code in Action" course:

  **CLAUDE.md Generation:**
  - Comprehensive codebase summary generated on bootstrap
  - Included in EVERY Claude request for persistent context
  - Contains: project summary, architecture, key files, critical patterns
  - Auto-updated by agents on significant changes

  **Three Memory Levels:**
  1. **Project Memory**: `.loki/CONTINUITY.md` + `CLAUDE.md` (shared, committed)
  2. **Agent Memory**: `.loki/memory/ledgers/` (per-agent, not committed)
  3. **Global Memory**: `.loki/rules/` (permanent patterns, committed)

  **Plan Mode Pattern:**
  - Research phase (read-only, find all relevant files)
  - Planning phase (create detailed plan, NO code yet)
  - Review checkpoint (get approval before implementing)
  - Implementation phase (execute plan systematically)
  - Use for: multi-file refactoring, architecture decisions, complex features

  **Thinking Mode:**
  - Trigger with "Ultra think" prefix
  - Extended reasoning budget for complex logic
  - Use for: subtle bugs, performance optimization, security assessment, architectural trade-offs

- **Hooks System (Quality Gates)**:

  **Pre-Tool-Use Hooks** - Block execution (exit code 2):
  - Prevent writes to auto-generated files
  - Validate implementation matches spec before write
  - Example: `.loki/hooks/pre-write.sh`

  **Post-Tool-Use Hooks** - Auto-fix after execution:
  - Type checking (TypeScript/mypy) with auto-fix feedback
  - Auto-formatting (Prettier, Black, gofmt)
  - Update CLAUDE.md on architecture changes
  - Example: `.loki/hooks/post-write.sh`

  **Deduplication Hook** - Prevent AI slop:
  - Launches separate Claude instance to detect duplicates
  - Suggests existing functions to reuse
  - Example: `.loki/hooks/post-write-deduplicate.sh`

- **Problem-Solving Workflows**:

  **3-Step Pattern** (for non-trivial tasks):
  1. Identify & Analyze: Grep/Read relevant files, create mental model
  2. Request Planning: Describe feature, get implementation plan (NO CODE)
  3. Implement Plan: Execute systematically, test after each file

  **Test-Driven Development Pattern:**
  1. Context Gathering: Read code, understand patterns, review spec
  2. Test Design: Ask Claude to suggest tests based on spec
  3. Test Implementation: Implement tests → FAIL (red phase)
  4. Implementation: Write code to pass tests → GREEN → refactor

- **Performance Optimization Pattern**:
  - Profile critical paths (benchmarks, profiling tools)
  - Create todo list of optimization opportunities
  - Implement fixes systematically
  - Real example: Chalk library 3.9x throughput improvement

### Changed
- **Directory Structure** - Added:
  - `.loki/hooks/` - Pre/post tool-use hooks for quality gates
  - `.loki/plans/` - Implementation plans (Plan Mode output)

- **Bootstrap Script** - Creates hooks/ and plans/ directories

- **RAR Cycle** - Enhanced with Claude Code patterns:
  - REASON: Read CONTINUITY.md + CLAUDE.md
  - ACT: Use hooks for quality gates
  - REFLECT: Update CONTINUITY.md + CLAUDE.md

### Best Practices
1. **Build incrementally** - Plan mode for architecture, small steps for implementation
2. **Maintain context** - Update CLAUDE.md and CONTINUITY.md continuously
3. **Verify outputs** - Use hooks for automated quality checks
4. **Prevent duplicates** - Deduplication hooks before shipping
5. **Test first** - TDD workflow prevents regressions
6. **Think deeply** - Use "Ultra think" for complex decisions
7. **Block bad writes** - Pre-tool-use hooks enforce quality gates

**"Claude Code functions best as flexible assistant that grows with team needs through tool expansion rather than fixed functionality"**

## [2.13.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** - Specifications as source of truth BEFORE code:

  **Philosophy**: `Spec → Tests from Spec → Code to Satisfy Spec → Validation`

  - OpenAPI 3.1 specifications written FIRST (before architecture/code)
  - Spec is executable contract between frontend/backend
  - Prevents API drift and breaking changes
  - Enables parallel development (frontend mocks from spec)
  - Documentation auto-generated from spec (always accurate)

  **Workflow**:
  1. Parse PRD and extract API requirements
  2. Generate OpenAPI spec with all endpoints, schemas, error codes
  3. Validate spec with Spectral linter
  4. Generate TypeScript types, client SDK, server stubs, docs
  5. Implement contract tests BEFORE implementation
  6. Code implements ONLY what's in spec
  7. CI/CD validates implementation against spec

  **Spec Storage**: `.loki/specs/openapi.yaml`

  **Spec Precedence**: Spec > PRD, Spec > Code, Spec > Documentation

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration** - Standardized agent communication:

  **Architecture**:
  - Each swarm is an MCP server (engineering, operations, business, data, growth)
  - Orchestrator is MCP client consuming swarm servers
  - Standardized tool/resource exchange protocol
  - Composable, interoperable agents

  **Benefits**:
  1. **Composability**: Mix agents from different sources
  2. **Interoperability**: Work with GitHub Copilot, other AI assistants
  3. **Modularity**: Each swarm is independent, replaceable
  4. **Discoverability**: Listed in GitHub MCP Registry
  5. **Reusability**: Other teams can use Loki agents standalone

  **MCP Servers Implemented**:
  - `loki-engineering-swarm`: Frontend, backend, database, QA agents
    - Tools: implement-feature, run-tests, review-code, refactor-code
    - Resources: loki://engineering/state, loki://engineering/continuity
  - `loki-operations-swarm`: DevOps, security, monitoring agents
    - Tools: deploy-application, run-security-scan, setup-monitoring
  - `loki-business-swarm`: Marketing, sales, legal agents
    - Tools: create-marketing-campaign, generate-sales-materials

  **External MCP Integration**:
  - GitHub MCP (create PRs, manage issues)
  - Playwright MCP (browser automation, E2E tests)
  - Notion MCP (knowledge base, documentation)

  **MCP Directory**: `.loki/mcp/` with servers/, orchestrator.ts, registry.yaml

- **Spec Evolution & Versioning**:
  - Semver for API versions (breaking → major, new endpoints → minor, fixes → patch)
  - Backwards compatibility via multiple version support (/v1, /v2)
  - Breaking change detection in CI/CD
  - 6-month deprecation migration path

- **Contract Testing**:
  - Tests written from spec BEFORE implementation
  - Request/response validation against OpenAPI schema
  - Auto-generated Postman collections
  - Schemathesis integration for fuzz testing

### Changed
- **Phase 2: Architecture** - Now SPEC-FIRST:
  1. Extract API requirements from PRD
  2. Generate OpenAPI 3.1 specification (BEFORE code)
  3. Generate artifacts from spec (types, SDK, stubs, docs)
  4. Select tech stack (based on spec requirements)
  5. Generate infrastructure requirements (from spec)
  6. Create project scaffolding (with contract testing)

- **Directory Structure** - Added new directories:
  - `.loki/specs/` - OpenAPI, GraphQL, AsyncAPI specifications
  - `.loki/mcp/` - MCP server implementations and registry
  - `.loki/logs/static-analysis/` - Static analysis results

- **Bootstrap Script** - Creates specs/ and mcp/ directories

### Philosophy
**"Be the best"** - Integrating top approaches from 2025:

1. **Agentic AI**: Autonomous agents that iterate, recognize errors, fix mistakes in real-time
2. **MCP**: Standardized agent communication for composability across platforms
3. **Spec-Driven Development**: Specifications as executable contracts, not afterthoughts

Loki Mode now combines the best practices from GitHub's ecosystem:
- **Speed**: Autonomous multi-agent development
- **Control**: Static analysis + AI review + spec validation
- **Interoperability**: MCP-compatible agents work with any AI platform
- **Quality**: Spec-first prevents drift, contract tests ensure compliance

"Specifications are the shared source of truth" - enabling parallel development, preventing API drift, and ensuring documentation accuracy.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Quality Control Principles** - Integrated GitHub's "Speed Without Control" framework:

  **Principle 1: Guardrails, Not Just Acceleration**
  - Static analysis before AI review (CodeQL, ESLint, Pylint, type checking)
  - Automated detection of unused vars, duplicated logic, code smells
  - Cyclomatic complexity limits (max 15 per function)
  - Secret scanning to prevent credential leaks
  - 5 quality gate categories with blocking rules

  **Principle 2: Structured Prompting for Subagents**
  - All subagent dispatches must include: GOAL, CONSTRAINTS, CONTEXT, OUTPUT FORMAT
  - Goals explain "what success looks like" (not just actions)
  - Constraints define boundaries (dependencies, compatibility, performance)
  - Context includes CONTINUITY.md, ledgers, learnings, architecture decisions
  - Output format specifies deliverables (tests, docs, benchmarks)

  **Principle 3: Document Decisions, Not Just Code**
  - Every completed task requires decision documentation
  - WHY: Problem, root cause, solution chosen, alternatives considered
  - WHAT: Files modified, APIs changed, behavior changes, dependencies
  - TRADE-OFFS: Gains, costs, neutral changes
  - RISKS: What could go wrong, mitigation strategies
  - TEST RESULTS: Unit/integration/performance metrics
  - NEXT STEPS: Follow-up tasks

- **AI Slop Prevention** - Automated detection and blocking:
  - Warning signs: quality degradation, copy-paste duplication, over-engineering
  - Missing error handling, generic variable names, magic numbers
  - Commented-out code, TODO comments without issues
  - Auto-fail and re-dispatch with stricter constraints

- **Two-Stage Code Review**:
  - **Stage 1**: Static analysis (automated) runs first
  - **Stage 2**: AI reviewers (opus/sonnet) only after static analysis passes
  - AI reviewers receive static analysis results as context
  - Prevents wasting AI review time on issues machines can catch

- **Enhanced Task Schema**:
  - `payload.goal` - High-level objective (required)
  - `payload.constraints` - Array of limitations
  - `payload.context` - Related files, ADRs, previous attempts
  - `result.decisionReport` - Complete Why/What/Trade-offs documentation
  - Decision reports archived to `.loki/logs/decisions/`

### Changed
- CODE_REVIEW phase now requires static analysis before AI reviewers
- Subagent dispatch template updated with GOAL/CONSTRAINTS/CONTEXT/OUTPUT
- Task completion requires decision documentation (not just code output)
- Quality gates now include static analysis tools (CodeQL, linters, security scanners)
- Context-Aware Subagent Dispatch section rewritten for structured prompting

### Philosophy
"Speed and control aren't trade-offs. They reinforce each other." - GitHub

AI accelerates velocity but can introduce "AI slop" (semi-functional code accumulating technical debt). Loki Mode now pairs acceleration with visible guardrails: static analysis catches machine-detectable issues, structured prompting ensures intentional development, and decision documentation demonstrates thinking beyond shipping features.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **CONTINUITY.md Working Memory Protocol** - Inspired by OpenAI's persistent memory pattern:
  - Single working memory file at `.loki/CONTINUITY.md`
  - Read at START of every RAR (Reason-Act-Reflect) cycle
  - Update at END of every RAR cycle
  - Primary source of truth for "what am I doing right now?"

- **Working Memory Template** includes:
  - Active goal and current task tracking
  - Just completed items (last 5)
  - Next actions in priority order
  - Active blockers
  - Key decisions this session
  - Working context and files being modified

- **Memory Hierarchy Clarification**:
  1. `CONTINUITY.md` - Active working memory (every turn)
  2. `ledgers/` - Agent checkpoint state (on milestones)
  3. `handoffs/` - Transfer documents (on agent switch)
  4. `learnings/` - Pattern extraction (on task completion)
  5. `rules/` - Permanent validated patterns

### Changed
- RAR cycle now explicitly reads CONTINUITY.md in REASON phase
- RAR cycle now explicitly updates CONTINUITY.md in REFLECT phase
- Bootstrap script creates initial CONTINUITY.md
- Context Continuity Protocol updated to prioritize CONTINUITY.md
- Directory structure updated to show CONTINUITY.md at root of `.loki/`

### Philosophy
CONTINUITY.md provides a simpler, more explicit "every turn" memory protocol that complements the existing sophisticated memory system. It ensures Claude always knows exactly what it's working on, what just happened, and what needs to happen next.

## [2.10.1] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- **API Console Upload** - Added `loki-mode-api-X.X.X.zip` artifact for console.anthropic.com
  - API requires SKILL.md inside a folder wrapper (`loki-mode/SKILL.md`)
  - Claude.ai uses flat structure (`SKILL.md` at root)
  - Updated release workflow to generate both formats
  - Three release artifacts now available:
    - `loki-mode-X.X.X.zip` - for Claude.ai website
    - `loki-mode-api-X.X.X.zip` - for console.anthropic.com
    - `loki-mode-claude-code-X.X.X.zip` - for Claude Code CLI

## [2.10.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Context Memory Management System** - Inspired by Continuous-Claude-v2:
  - **Ledger-based state preservation** - Save state to `.loki/memory/ledgers/` instead of letting context degrade through compaction
  - **Agent Handoff System** - Clean context transfer between agents at `.loki/memory/handoffs/`
  - **Session Learnings** - Extract patterns and learnings to `.loki/memory/learnings/`
  - **Compound Rules** - Promote proven patterns to permanent rules at `.loki/rules/`
  - **Context Clear Signals** - Agent can request context reset via `.loki/signals/CONTEXT_CLEAR_REQUESTED`

- **Memory Directory Structure**:
  ```
  .loki/memory/
  ├── ledgers/     # Current state per agent
  ├── handoffs/    # Agent-to-agent transfers
  └── learnings/   # Extracted patterns
  .loki/rules/     # Permanent proven rules
  .loki/signals/   # Inter-process communication
  ```

- **Context Injection on Resume** - Wrapper now loads ledger and handoff context when resuming iterations

### Changed
- Prompts now include memory management instructions
- Wrapper initializes memory directory structure
- Build prompt includes ledger/handoff content for continuity

### Philosophy
Instead of "degrade gracefully through compression", Loki Mode now uses "reset cleanly with memory preservation" - ensuring perfect context continuity across unlimited iterations.

## [2.9.1] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Immediate continuation on success** - Successful iterations (exit code 0) now continue immediately
- No more 17+ minute waits between successful iterations
- Exponential backoff only applies to errors or rate limits

## [2.9.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Ralph Wiggum Mode** - True perpetual autonomous operation:
  - Reason-Act-Reflect (RAR) cycle for every iteration
  - Products are NEVER "complete" - always improvements to make
  - Stripped all interactive safety gates
  - Perpetual loop continues even when Claude claims completion

- **Perpetual Improvement Loop** - New philosophy:
  - Claude never declares "done" - there's always more to improve
  - When queue empties: find new improvements, run SDLC phases again, hunt bugs
  - Only stops on: max iterations, explicit completion promise, or user interrupt

- **New Environment Variables**:
  - `LOKI_COMPLETION_PROMISE` - EXPLICIT stop condition (must output exact text)
  - `LOKI_MAX_ITERATIONS` - Safety limit (default: 1000)
  - `LOKI_PERPETUAL_MODE` - Ignore ALL completion signals (default: false)

- **Completion Promise Detection** - Only stops when Claude outputs the exact promise text
  - Example: `LOKI_COMPLETION_PROMISE="ALL TESTS PASSING 100%"`
  - Claude must explicitly output "COMPLETION PROMISE FULFILLED: ALL TESTS PASSING 100%"

### Changed
- Default behavior now runs perpetually until max iterations
- Removed auto-completion based on "finalized" phase (was allowing hallucinated completion)
- Prompts now emphasize never stopping, always finding improvements
- SKILL.md completely rewritten for Ralph Wiggum Mode philosophy

## [2.8.1] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **Dashboard showing all 0s** - Added explicit instructions to SKILL.md to use queue JSON files instead of TodoWrite tool
- Claude now properly populates `.loki/queue/*.json` files for live dashboard tracking
- Added queue system usage guide with JSON format and examples

### Changed
- SKILL.md now explicitly prohibits TodoWrite in favor of queue system
- Added "Task Management: Use Queue System" section with clear examples

## [2.8.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- **Smart Rate Limit Detection** - Automatically detects rate limit messages and waits until reset:
  - Parses "resets Xam/pm" from Claude output
  - Calculates exact wait time until reset (+ 2 min buffer)
  - Shows human-readable countdown (e.g., "4h 30m")
  - Longer countdown intervals for multi-hour waits (60s vs 10s)
  - No more wasted retry attempts during rate limits

### Changed
- Countdown display now shows human-readable format (e.g., "Resuming in 4h 28m...")

## [2.7.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Codebase Analysis Mode** - When no PRD is provided, Loki Mode now:
  1. **Auto-detects PRD files** - Searches for `PRD.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `SPEC.md`, `PROJECT.md` and docs variants
  2. **Analyzes existing codebase** - If no PRD found, performs comprehensive codebase analysis:
     - Scans directory structure and identifies tech stack
     - Reads package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.
     - Examines README and entry points
     - Identifies current features and architecture
  3. **Generates PRD** - Creates `.loki/generated-prd.md` with:
     - Project overview and current state
     - Inferred requirements from implementation
     - Identified gaps (missing tests, security, docs)
     - Recommended improvements
  4. **Proceeds with SDLC** - Uses generated PRD as baseline for all testing phases

### Fixed
- Dashboard 404 errors - Server now runs from `.loki/` root to properly serve queue/state JSON files
- Updated dashboard URL to `/dashboard/index.html`

## [2.6.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Complete SDLC Testing Phases** - 11 comprehensive testing phases (all enabled by default):
  - `UNIT_TESTS` - Run existing unit tests with coverage

- **Phase Skip Options** - Each phase can be disabled via environment variables:
  - `LOKI_PHASE_UNIT_TESTS=false` to skip unit tests
  - `LOKI_PHASE_SECURITY=false` to skip security scanning
  - etc.

### Changed
- Prompt now includes `SDLC_PHASES_ENABLED: [...]` to inform Claude which phases to execute
- SKILL.md updated with detailed instructions for each SDLC phase

## [2.5.0] - 2025-12-28
