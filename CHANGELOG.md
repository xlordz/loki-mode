  - etc.

### Changed
- Prompt now includes `SDLC_PHASES_ENABLED: [...]` to inform Claude which phases to execute
- SKILL.md updated with detailed instructions for each SDLC phase

## [2.5.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Real-time Streaming Output** - Claude's output now streams live using `--output-format stream-json`
  - Parses JSON stream in real-time to display text, tool calls, and results
  - Shows `[Tool: name]` when Claude uses a tool
  - Shows `[Session complete]` when done
- **Web Dashboard** - Visual task board with Anthropic design language
  - Cream/beige background with coral (#D97757) accents matching Anthropic branding
  - Auto-starts at `http://127.0.0.1:57374` and opens in browser
  - Shows task counts and Kanban-style columns (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Failed)
  - Auto-refreshes every 3 seconds
  - Disable with `LOKI_DASHBOARD=false`
  - Configure port with `LOKI_DASHBOARD_PORT=<port>`

### Changed
- Replaced `--print` mode with `--output-format stream-json --verbose` for proper streaming
- Python-based JSON parser extracts and displays Claude's responses in real-time
- Simple HTML dashboard replaces Vibe Kanban (no external dependencies)

### Fixed
- Live output now actually streams (was buffered until completion in 2.4.0)
- Completion detection now recognizes `finalized` and `growth-loop` phases
- Prompt now explicitly instructs Claude to act autonomously without asking questions
- Added `.loki/COMPLETED` marker file detection for clean exit

## [2.4.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Live Output** - Claude's output now streams in real-time using pseudo-TTY
  - Uses `script` command to allocate PTY for proper streaming
  - Visual separator shows when Claude is working
- **Status Monitor** - `.loki/STATUS.txt` updates every 5 seconds with:
  - Current phase
  - Task counts (pending, in-progress, completed, failed)
  - Monitor with: `watch -n 2 cat .loki/STATUS.txt`

### Changed
- Replaced Vibe Kanban auto-launch with simpler status file monitor
- Autonomy runner uses `script` for proper TTY output on macOS/Linux

## [2.3.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- **Unified Autonomy Runner** (`autonomy/run.sh`) - Single script that does everything:
  - Prerequisite checks (Claude CLI, Python, Git, curl, Node.js, jq)
  - Skill installation verification
  - `.loki/` directory initialization
  - Autonomous execution with auto-resume
  - ASCII art banner and colored logging
  - Exponential backoff with jitter
  - State persistence across restarts
  - See `autonomy/README.md` for detailed docs

### Changed
- Moved autonomous execution to dedicated `autonomy/` folder (separate from skill)
- Updated README with new Quick Start using `./autonomy/run.sh`
- Release workflow now includes `autonomy/` folder

### Deprecated
- `scripts/loki-wrapper.sh` still works but `autonomy/run.sh` is now recommended

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- **Vibe Kanban Integration** - Optional visual dashboard for monitoring agents:
  - `integrations/vibe-kanban.md` - Full integration guide
  - `scripts/export-to-vibe-kanban.sh` - Export Loki tasks to Vibe Kanban format
  - Task status mapping (Loki queues → Kanban columns)
  - Phase-to-column mapping for visual progress tracking
  - Metadata preservation for debugging
  - See [BloopAI/vibe-kanban](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban)

### Documentation
- README: Added Integrations section with Vibe Kanban setup

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- **Autonomous Wrapper Script** (`scripts/loki-wrapper.sh`) - True autonomy with auto-resume:
  - Monitors Claude Code process and detects when session ends
  - Automatically resumes from checkpoint on rate limits or interruptions
  - Exponential backoff with jitter (configurable via environment variables)
  - State persistence in `.loki/wrapper-state.json`
  - Completion detection via orchestrator state or `.loki/COMPLETED` marker
  - Clean shutdown handling with SIGINT/SIGTERM traps
  - Configurable: `LOKI_MAX_RETRIES`, `LOKI_BASE_WAIT`, `LOKI_MAX_WAIT`

### Documentation
- Added True Autonomy section to README explaining wrapper usage
- Documented how wrapper detects session completion and rate limits

## [2.0.3] - 2025-12-27

### Fixed
- **Proper Skill File Format** - Release artifacts now follow Claude's expected format:
  - `loki-mode-X.X.X.zip` / `.skill` - For Claude.ai (SKILL.md at root)
  - `loki-mode-claude-code-X.X.X.zip` - For Claude Code (loki-mode/ folder)

### Improved
- **Installation Instructions** - Separate instructions for Claude.ai vs Claude Code
- **SKILL.md** - Already has required YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`

## [2.0.2] - 2025-12-27

### Fixed
- **Release Artifact Structure** - Zip now contains `loki-mode/` folder (not `loki-mode-X.X.X/`)
  - Users can extract directly to skills directory without renaming
  - Only includes essential skill files (no .git or .github folders)

### Improved
- **Installation Instructions** - Updated README with clearer extraction steps

## [2.0.1] - 2025-12-27

### Improved
- **Installation Documentation** - Comprehensive installation guide:
  - Explains which file is the actual skill (`SKILL.md`)
  - Shows skill file structure and required files
  - Option 1: Download from GitHub Releases (recommended)
  - Option 2: Git clone
  - Option 3: Minimal install with curl commands
  - Verification steps

  - macOS-compatible timeout wrapper with Perl fallback
  - Heartbeat-based stuck agent detection
  - Watchdog pattern for long operations
  - Graceful termination handling with SIGTERM/SIGKILL

### Changed
