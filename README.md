## Installation

### npm (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g loki-mode
```

Installs the `loki` CLI and automatically sets up the skill for Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI.

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap asklokesh/tap && brew install loki-mode
```

Installs the `loki` CLI. To also install the skill for interactive use:

```bash
loki setup-skill
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# CLI mode (works with any provider)
loki start ./prd.md
loki start ./prd.md --provider codex
loki start ./prd.md --provider gemini

# Interactive mode (inside your coding agent)
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
# Then say: "Loki Mode with PRD at ./my-prd.md"

# Or in Codex CLI:
codex
# Then say: "Use Loki Mode with PRD at ./my-prd.md"

# Or in Gemini CLI:
gemini
# Then say: "Use Loki Mode with PRD at ./my-prd.md"
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
loki --version    # Should print 5.51.0
loki doctor       # Check skill symlinks and provider availability
```

### Other Methods

Git clone, Docker, GitHub Action, and VS Code Extension are also available. See [docs/alternative-installations.md](docs/alternative-installations.md).

### Update

```bash
npm update -g loki-mode    # npm
brew upgrade loki-mode     # Homebrew
```

### Multi-Provider Support (v5.0.0)

| Provider | Features | Parallel Agents | Task Tool |
|----------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Claude | Full | Yes (10+) | Yes |
| Codex | Degraded | No | No |
| Gemini | Degraded | No | No |

See [skills/providers.md](skills/providers.md) for full provider documentation.

---

## Benchmarks

Benchmark infrastructure is included for HumanEval and SWE-bench evaluation. Results are self-reported from the included test harness and have not been independently verified.

| Benchmark | Result | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| HumanEval | 162/164 (98.78%) | Self-reported, max 3 retries per problem |
| SWE-bench | 299/300 patches generated | Patch generation only -- SWE-bench evaluator not yet run to verify correctness |

**Note:** SWE-bench "patch generation" means the system produced a patch file, not that the patch correctly resolves the issue. The SWE-bench evaluator should be run to determine actual resolution rates.

See [benchmarks/](benchmarks/) for the test harness and raw results.

---

## What is Loki Mode?

Loki Mode is a multi-provider AI skill that orchestrates **41 specialized AI agent types** across **8 swarms** to autonomously build, test, and deploy software projects. Works with **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex CLI**, and **Google Gemini CLI**. It dynamically spawns agents as needed -- typically **5-10 for simple projects, more for complex ones** -- working in parallel with continuous self-verification.

```
PRD → Research → Architecture → Development → Testing → Deployment → Marketing
```

**Just say "Loki Mode" and point to a PRD. Walk away. Come back to a deployed product.**

---

## Current Limitations

Loki Mode is powerful but not magic. Be aware of these honest limitations:

| Area | What Works | What Doesn't (Yet) |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Code Generation** | Generates full-stack applications from PRDs | Complex domain logic may need human review and correction |
| **Deployment** | Generates deployment configs and scripts | Does not have cloud credentials -- human must provide and authorize |
| **Testing** | 9 automated quality gates, blind review | Test quality depends on AI-generated assertions; mutation testing is heuristic |
| **Business Ops** | Generates marketing copy, legal templates | Does not actually send emails, file legal documents, or process payments |
| **Multi-Provider** | Claude (full), Codex (degraded), Gemini (degraded) | Codex and Gemini lack parallel agents and Task tool -- sequential only |
| **Memory System** | Episodic, semantic, procedural memory tiers | Vector search requires optional `sentence-transformers` dependency |
| **Enterprise Security** | TLS, OIDC, RBAC, audit trail, SIEM configs | Self-signed certs only; production deployments need real certificates |
| **Dashboard** | Real-time status, task queue, agent monitoring | Single-machine only; no multi-node dashboard clustering |
| **Benchmarks** | HumanEval 98.78%, SWE-bench 299/300 patches | Self-reported; SWE-bench counts patch generation, not verified resolution |

**What "autonomous" means in practice:**
- Loki Mode runs without prompting between RARV cycles
- It does NOT have access to your cloud accounts, payment systems, or external services unless you provide credentials
- Human oversight is expected for: deployment credentials, domain setup, API keys, and critical business decisions
- The system is as good as the underlying AI model -- it can make mistakes, especially on novel or complex problems

## What To Expect

| Project Type | Examples | Autonomy Level | Typical Experience |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple | Landing page, todo app, static site, single API | High | Completes with minimal retries. Human reviews output. |
| Standard | CRUD app with auth, REST API + React frontend | Medium | Completes most features. Complex components may need guidance. |
| Complex | Microservices, real-time systems, ML pipelines | Guided | Use as accelerator. Human reviews between phases. |

"Autonomous" means the system runs RARV cycles without prompting. It does NOT mean zero oversight.

## Why Loki Mode?

### **How It Works**

| What Others Do | What Loki Mode Does |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Single agent** writes code linearly | **Multiple agents** work in parallel across engineering, ops, business, data, product, and growth |
| **Manual deployment** required | **Autonomous deployment** to AWS, GCP, Azure, Vercel, Railway with blue-green and canary strategies |
| **No testing** or basic unit tests | **9 automated quality gates**: input/output guardrails, static analysis, blind review, anti-sycophancy, severity blocking, test coverage, mock detection, mutation detection |
| **Code only** - you handle the rest | **Full business operations**: marketing, sales, legal, HR, finance, investor relations |
| **Stops on errors** | **Self-healing**: circuit breakers, dead letter queues, exponential backoff, automatic recovery |
| **No visibility** into progress | **Real-time dashboard** with agent monitoring, task queues, and live status updates |
| **"Done" when code is written** | **Never "done"**: continuous optimization, A/B testing, customer feedback loops, perpetual improvement |
| **No security controls** | **Enterprise-ready**: TLS/HTTPS, OIDC/SSO, RBAC, audit trails, SIEM integration, Prometheus metrics (v5.36.0-v5.38.0) |
| **Direct commits to main** | **Branch protection**: auto-create feature branches, clean PR workflow, never touches main directly (v5.37.0) |

### **Core Advantages**

1. **Self-Verifying**: RARV (Reason-Act-Reflect-Verify) cycle with continuous self-verification catches errors early
2. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents working simultaneously, not sequential single-agent bottlenecks
3. **Production-Ready**: Not just code—handles deployment, monitoring, incident response, and business operations
4. **Self-Improving**: Learns from mistakes, updates continuity logs, prevents repeated errors
5. **Zero Babysitting**: Auto-resumes on rate limits, recovers from failures, runs until completion
6. **Efficiency Optimized**: ToolOrchestra-inspired metrics track cost per task, reward signals drive continuous improvement

## Dashboard & Real-Time Monitoring

Monitor your autonomous startup being built in real-time through the Loki Mode dashboard:

### **Agent Monitoring**

<img width="1200" alt="Loki Mode Dashboard - Active Agents" src="docs/screenshots/dashboard-agents.png" />

**Track all active agents in real-time:**
- **Agent ID** and **Type** (frontend, backend, QA, DevOps, etc.)
- **Model Badge** (Sonnet, Haiku, Opus) with color coding
- **Current Work** being performed
- **Runtime** and **Tasks Completed**
- **Status** (active, completed)

### **Task Queue Visualization**

<img width="1200" alt="Loki Mode Dashboard - Task Queue" src="docs/screenshots/dashboard-tasks.png" />

**Four-column kanban view:**
- **Pending**: Queued tasks waiting for agents
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Successfully finished (shows last 10)
- **Failed**: Tasks requiring attention

### **Live Status Monitor**

```bash
# Watch status updates in terminal
watch -n 2 cat .loki/STATUS.txt
```

```

## Autonomous Capabilities

### **RARV Cycle: Reason-Act-Reflect-Verify**

Loki Mode doesn't just write code—it **thinks, acts, learns, and verifies**:

```
1. REASON
   └─ Read .loki/CONTINUITY.md including "Mistakes & Learnings"
   └─ Check .loki/state/ and .loki/queue/
   └─ Identify next task or improvement

2. ACT
   └─ Execute task, write code
   └─ Commit changes atomically (git checkpoint)

3. REFLECT
   └─ Update .loki/CONTINUITY.md with progress
   └─ Update state files
   └─ Identify NEXT improvement

4. VERIFY
   └─ Run automated tests (unit, integration, E2E)
   └─ Check compilation/build
   └─ Verify against spec

   IF VERIFICATION FAILS:
   ├─ Capture error details (stack trace, logs)
   ├─ Analyze root cause
   ├─ UPDATE "Mistakes & Learnings" in CONTINUITY.md
   ├─ Rollback to last good git checkpoint if needed
   └─ Apply learning and RETRY from REASON
```

**Result:** Improved quality through continuous self-verification and multi-reviewer code review.

### **Perpetual Improvement Mode**

There is **NEVER** a "finished" state. After completing the PRD, Loki Mode:
- Runs performance optimizations
- Adds missing test coverage
- Improves documentation
- Refactors code smells
- Updates dependencies
- Enhances user experience
- Implements A/B test learnings

**It keeps going until you stop it.**

### **Auto-Resume & Self-Healing**

**Rate limits?** Exponential backoff and automatic resume.
**Errors?** Circuit breakers, dead letter queues, retry logic.
**Interruptions?** State checkpoints every 5 seconds—just restart.

```bash
# Start autonomous mode
./autonomy/run.sh ./docs/requirements.md

# Hit rate limit? Script automatically:
# ├─ Saves state checkpoint
# ├─ Waits with exponential backoff (60s → 120s → 240s...)
# ├─ Resumes from exact point
# └─ Continues until completion or max retries (default: 50)
```

---

## Quick Start

**Key components:**
- **RARV+C Cycle** -- Reason, Act, Reflect, Verify, Compound. Every iteration follows this loop. Failed verification triggers retry from Reason.
- **Provider Layer** -- Claude Code (full parallel agents, Task tool, MCP), Codex CLI and Gemini CLI (sequential, degraded mode).
- **Agent Swarms** -- 41 specialized agent types across 8 swarms, spawned on demand based on project complexity.
- **Completion Council** -- 3 members vote on whether the project is done. Anti-sycophancy devil's advocate on unanimous votes.
- **Memory System** -- Episodic traces, semantic patterns, procedural skills. Progressive disclosure reduces context usage by 60-80%.
- **Dashboard** -- FastAPI server reading `.loki/` flat files, with real-time web UI for task queue, agents, logs, and council state. Now with TLS/HTTPS, OIDC/SSO, and RBAC (v5.36.0-v5.37.0).
- **Metrics Export** -- Prometheus/OpenMetrics endpoint for production monitoring (v5.38.0).
- **Audit Trail** -- SHA-256 integrity chain for tamper-evident logging of all agent actions (v5.37.0).

Config search order: `.loki/config.yaml` (project) -> `~/.config/loki-mode/config.yaml` (global)

---

## Agent Swarms (41 Types)

Loki Mode has **41 predefined agent types** organized into **8 specialized swarms**. The orchestrator spawns only what you need -- simple projects typically use 5-10 agents, complex ones may use more.

<img width="5309" height="979" alt="Agent Swarms Visualization" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d18635d-a606-401f-8d9f-430e6e4ee689" />

### **Engineering (8 types)**
`eng-frontend` `eng-backend` `eng-database` `eng-mobile` `eng-api` `eng-qa` `eng-perf` `eng-infra`

### **Operations (8 types)**
`ops-devops` `ops-sre` `ops-security` `ops-monitor` `ops-incident` `ops-release` `ops-cost` `ops-compliance`

### **Business (8 types)**
`biz-marketing` `biz-sales` `biz-finance` `biz-legal` `biz-support` `biz-hr` `biz-investor` `biz-partnerships`

### **Data (3 types)**

## How It Works

### **Skill Architecture (v3.0+)**

Loki Mode uses a **progressive disclosure architecture** to minimize context usage:

```
SKILL.md (~190 lines)         # Always loaded: core RARV cycle, autonomy rules
skills/
  00-index.md                  # Module routing table
  agents.md                    # Agent dispatch, A2A patterns
  production.md                # HN patterns, batch processing, CI/CD
  quality-gates.md             # Review system, severity handling
  testing.md                   # Playwright, E2E, property-based
  model-selection.md           # Task tool, parallelization
  artifacts.md                 # Code generation patterns
  patterns-advanced.md         # Constitutional AI, debate
  troubleshooting.md           # Error recovery, fallbacks
references/                    # Deep documentation (23KB+ files)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Original 1,517-line SKILL.md consumed ~15% of context before any work began
- Now only ~1% of context for core skill + on-demand modules
- More room for actual code and reasoning

### **Phase Execution**

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **0. Bootstrap** | Create `.loki/` directory structure, initialize state |
| **1. Discovery** | Parse PRD, competitive research via web search |
| **2. Architecture** | Tech stack selection with self-reflection |
| **3. Infrastructure** | Provision cloud, CI/CD, monitoring |
| **4. Development** | Implement with TDD, parallel code review |
| **5. QA** | 9 quality gates, security audit, load testing |
| **6. Deployment** | Blue-green deploy, auto-rollback on errors |
| **7. Business** | Marketing, sales, legal, support setup |
| **8. Growth** | Continuous optimization, A/B testing, feedback loops |

### **Parallel Code Review**

Every code change goes through **3 specialized reviewers simultaneously**:

```

### **Memory System (v5.15.0)**

Complete 3-tier memory architecture with progressive disclosure:

```
WORKING MEMORY (CONTINUITY.md)
        |
        v
EPISODIC MEMORY (.loki/memory/episodic/)
        |
        v (consolidation)
SEMANTIC MEMORY (.loki/memory/semantic/)
        |
        v
PROCEDURAL MEMORY (.loki/memory/skills/)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Progressive Disclosure**: 3-layer loading (index ~100 tokens, timeline ~500 tokens, full details) reduces context usage by 60-80%
- **Token Economics**: Track discovery vs read tokens, automatic threshold-based optimization
- **Vector Search**: Optional embedding-based similarity search (sentence-transformers)
- **Consolidation Pipeline**: Automatic episodic-to-semantic transformation
- **Task-Aware Retrieval**: Different memory strategies for exploration, implementation, debugging, review, and refactoring

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
loki memory index           # View index layer
loki memory timeline        # View compressed history
loki memory consolidate     # Run consolidation pipeline
loki memory economics       # View token usage metrics
loki memory retrieve "query"  # Test task-aware retrieval
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/memory/summary` - Memory summary
- `POST /api/memory/retrieve` - Query memories
- `POST /api/memory/consolidate` - Trigger consolidation
- `GET /api/memory/economics` - Token economics

See [references/memory-system.md](references/memory-system.md) for complete documentation.

## Integrations

### **Vibe Kanban (Visual Dashboard)**

Integrate with [Vibe Kanban](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban) for a visual kanban board:

```bash
# 1. Start Vibe Kanban (terminal 1)
npx vibe-kanban

# 2. Run Loki Mode (terminal 2)
./autonomy/run.sh ./prd.md

# 3. Export tasks to see them in Vibe Kanban (terminal 3)
./scripts/export-to-vibe-kanban.sh

# 4. Optional: Auto-sync for real-time updates
./scripts/vibe-sync-watcher.sh
```

**Important:** Vibe Kanban integration requires manual export. Tasks don't automatically appear - you must run the export script to sync.

**Benefits:**
- Visual progress tracking of all active agents
- Manual intervention/prioritization when needed
- Code review with visual diffs
- Multi-project dashboard

See [integrations/vibe-kanban.md](integrations/vibe-kanban.md) for complete step-by-step setup guide and troubleshooting.

### **OpenClaw Bridge (v5.38.0)**

Loki Mode now supports the OpenClaw multi-agent coordination protocol for cross-system orchestration:

```bash
# Enable OpenClaw bridge
export LOKI_OPENCLAW_ENABLED=true
export LOKI_OPENCLAW_ENDPOINT=http://openclaw-server:8080

# Start with OpenClaw integration
loki start --openclaw ./prd.md
```

**Benefits:**
- Standardized inter-agent communication across different AI systems
- Coordinate with external agent frameworks (AutoGPT, MetaGPT, etc.)
- Share task queues and state between multiple orchestrators
- Cross-platform agent collaboration

See [docs/openclaw-integration.md](docs/openclaw-integration.md) for complete setup and API reference.
